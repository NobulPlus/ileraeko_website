      title: 'LAGOS TARGETS ONE MILLION ENROLLEES FOR ILERA EKO INSURANCE SCHEME',
      description: 'Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu on Tuesday inaugurated a special insurance scheme targeting at least one million individuals in the informal sector, noting it is designed to reduce out-of-pocket and huge medical bills.',

      mainPost: `The event witnessed the launch of the ILERA EKO Standard Jaara Health Insurance Plan and the commissioning of five Virtual Booths to cater to market men and women. The V Booths are situated at Ketu, Ayetoro, Sabo, Adamo, and Epe markets. There was also the investiture of the Governor as the Grand Ambassador of Universal Health Care of Lagos State. 
      Sanwo-Olu said, “The initiatives we are launching today further confirm LASHMA’s long history of improving healthcare accessibility.One of them is the new ILERA EKO Standard Jaara Health Insurance Plan, which offers additional benefits and peace of mind by reducing the financial burden of medical bills. In this plan, we have heavily subsidized the health insurance premium to ensure that everyone can access healthcare.

      “I call on the informal sector, which constitutes 70 percent of the population in the State, to seize the opportunity and enroll in ILERA EKO to reduce out-of-pocket and huge payment of medical bills.

      “I invite the formal sector also to come on board and ensure that their employees are registered and enrolled in ILERA EKO as this will automatically reduce the expenses of the companies, especially for the payment of medical bills.

      “Let me add here that the Enforcement team to handle the implementation of the Lagos State Health Scheme (LSHS) Law and the domestication of the National Health Insurance Authority (NHIA) Act has been constituted and trained.

      “Even though this administration believes more in enlightenment than enforcement, the law still needs to be implemented and obeyed. Therefore, violators of the law will not go unpunished when the enforcement takes full effect.

      “Today, I am delighted that five Virtual Booths, which will provide accessible healthcare to people in the informal sector, are ready for commissioning.

      “These booths are designed to bring healthcare closer to the people and expand the reach of LASHMA’s health insurance scheme, ILERA EKO, across the state. It is particularly useful for our hardworking market men and women who usually find it difficult to leave their shops and wares to take sometimes long trips to hospitals when they are sick. They will serve as first-line health services in the different informal business clusters around the state,” the Governor stated.

      Chairman of the Lagos State Health Management Agency (LASHMA), Adebayo Adedewe, in his address said, “We leverage technology right from the point of registration, uploading on our platform, payment processes, claims processes, and management, up to accessing care at the hospital and identifying the vulnerable in our society. In fact, everything in LASHMA is digitalized. Our 24/7 Customer Service Centre is also not left behind as technology has been deployed to ensure that customers’ complaints are well received, processed, and stored.

      “Our success story today is based on the feedback that we received from our customers, especially from the informal sector, either directly or indirectly through our various weekly radio programmes, social media handles, and providers.”

      He explained that the commitment to provide quality and affordable healthcare, as well as have a robust benefit package to cope with the medical challenges being faced by the people in the State, is responsible for the new Health Insurance Plan.

      “The new Health Insurance Plan, ILERA EKO Standard Jaara, has more benefits than the ILERA EKO Standard Plan, which is our basic Plan. In addition to the benefits enjoyed on the Standard Plan, enrollees on the new Plan will henceforth enjoy annual wellness checks, telemedicine service, and eye surgery (cataract), among others,” he noted.

      In an interview with newsmen, the Permanent Secretary of LASHMA, Dr. Emmanuella Zamba, said, “When LASHMA rebranded in 2021, we had some primary care and some secondary care. There are many things in this package that cover you, including cancer care if you have been on this plan for two years. We also have the Standard Plus and our new baby Jaara Plus.”

      She added, “The price of the health insurance is very affordable with a package starting at 8,500 for an individual. In the next year, we are thinking of enrolling another one million into the system.”`,

      title: 'LASHMA SUPPORTS ILERA EKO PRIVATE PROVIDERS WITH ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORD SOFTWARE',
      description: 'To improve service delivery and seamless healthcare access for ILERA EKO enrollees, LASHMA equipped private providers with Electronic Medical Record (EMR) software.',
      image: newsImage5,
      mainPost: `The Permanent Secretary of LASHMA, Dr. Emmanuella Zamba, speaking during the handover and demo of the EMR software donated to Lifesource Hospital, Ikorodu, said that the support to private health facilities under the ILERA EKO scheme became necessary to ensure that both the Agency and the Providers are on the same page in the use of technology.

      Dr. Zamba said that some of the health facilities without EMR software often experience delays in submitting their claims; since data is important for the sustainability of health insurance, technological support to ILERA EKO health facilities that are yet to be digitised is timely.  

      The Permanent Secretary noted that with the deployment of the technology, waiting time by Enrollees and consultation period by the Hospitals will be reduced making service provision more efficient. She also added that enrolment into the Health insurance scheme will increase.  

      Dr. Zamba further noted that the EMR software is patient-friendly as Enrollees will have access to their medical records including laboratory tests, can upload their vitals for instance blood pressure via a link, access telemedicine services and can also get the results of their tests through emails among others. 

      The Permanent Secretary applauded Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu for facilitating the provision of the EMR software to private health facilities under the ILERA EKO scheme, adding that there is no doubt that the technology will go a long way in reducing the bottlenecks associated with the access and provision of healthcare services.

      She disclosed that the Agency has about 250 private facilities under the Scheme and the digital technology will be provided for 25 per cent of the private facilities in this first phase. 

      Dr. Zamba appealed to private facilities under ILERA EKO that do not have EMR software and will not benefit in the first phase of the exercise, that it will soon be their turn. She added that the Agency has taken note of the private Hospitals yet to benefit and very soon, will do the needful.

      The Permanent Secretary urged health facilities in the State which are yet to register with the Agency, not to hesitate to join the Scheme so that they can be part of history when Lagos State attains Universal Health Coverage (UHC). 

      She commended the Board Chairman, LASHMA, Dr. Adebayo Adedewe, for his support in ensuring that the provision of the EMR software to private Hospitals under ILERA EKO became a reality. 

      The Founder and Chief Executive Officer, Clinify EMR Technology Services Limited, Engr. Michael Omidele explained that the operations of the EMR  commenced right from when ILERA EKO Enrollees visit the Record Desk up till when Enrollees get their drugs and leave the Hospitals. 

      He added that ILERA EKO Enrollees have been pre-registered on the digital technology and therefore, with the software, the era of documenting patients’ information on paper is gone. 

      The Founder, who explained that Clinify EMR is the first EMR in Africa that can allow Hospitals to submit their claims directly to Health Maintenance Organisations (HMOs) and the only oncology EMR software, for now, that can be used for cancer patients, added that with the EMR, medical personnel can log onto 20 to 50  various laboratories and Pharmacies that they are working with.

      Engr. Omidele said that Hospitals can have access to about 500 different tests on the EMR and can also have templates set up to suit the Hospital. In case, the Hospital has several branches, the EMR software, he said, gives room for multiple link-up. 

      He also said that the innovation has room for multi-language to be used to ensure that medical personnel have effective communication with their patients, especially those who are not literate.

      Eng. Omidele commended the Lagos State Government, Board Chairman, LASHMA, Dr. Adebayo Adedewe and Permanent Secretary, LASHMA, Dr. Emmanuella Zamba, for allowing him to serve the State. 

      The Director of Operations, Lifesource Hospital, Ikorodu, said that as the world is moving with technology, also, Hospitals must embrace technology. She added that the EMR software support from the Lagos State Health Management Agency (LASHMA), will have a great impact on the service delivery of the Hospital as quick medical attention will be given to ILERA EKO Enrollees and other private patients accessing care in the Hospital. 

      Mrs. Fadiya said that digital technology will also create ease in the workplace for medical personnel as it will reduce the time spent attending to patients. While appreciating LASHMA for extending the EMR to Lifesource Hospital, she said that ILERA EKO is the future of Health Insurance in Nigeria. 

      The Medical Doctor, Lifesource Hospital, Dr. Barry James, while attending to the first patient with the software, said that the technology, no doubt, would go a long way as far as patient care and record keeping are concerned. He added that the era of looking for documents or misplaced documents is gone with the technology.`,
